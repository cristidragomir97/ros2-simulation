This is a simple base recipe for docker-based ROS simulations. It includes the following functionality:
* ROS Humble desktop installation with RViz and Gazebo
* Web remote desktop access trough noVNC
* Turtlebot 3 full installation (for now)

Planned functionality: 
- Spawn launchfiles automatically on start
- Record rosbag files automatically
- Retrieve rosbag files automatically
